class FlipAxis(iaa.Fliplr):
    """ Flips the input image and keypoints across an axis.

    A generalized class for flipping images and keypoints
    either horizontally and vertically during augmentation.
    This class requires a swap_index parameter, which indicates the
    relationships between keypoint labels when flipping the image
    (e.g. left leg is swapped with right leg, etc.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    swap_index: deepposekit.io.BaseGenerator or array
        The keypoint indices to swap when the image is flipped.
        This can be a deepposekit.io.BaseGenerator for annotations
        or an array of integers specifying which keypoint indices
        to swap.

    axis: int, default 0
        Axis over which images are flipped
        axis=0 flips up-down (np.flipud)
        axis=1 flips left-right (np.fliplr)

    name: None or str, default None
        Name given to the Augmenter object. The name is used in print().
        If left as None, will print 'UnnamedX'

    deterministic: bool, default False
        If set to true, each batch will be augmented the same way.

    random_state: None or int or np.random.RandomState, default None
        The random state for the augmenter.

    Attributes
    ----------
    axis: int
        The axis to reflect the image.

    swap_index: array
        The keypoint indices to swap when the image is flipped
